                                <p>Admiral is an award-winning, multi-national insurance company based in South Wales.
                               </p>

                                <p>As part of Data and Analytics (DnA) I worked towards Admiral&rsquo;s digital data
                                    goals by creating web applications that make use of data from cloud technology.
                                    The
                                    tools not only provide more detailed business insights but at a much faster pace.

                                <h3>The Team</h3>
                                <p>At Admiral I worked within a self-organising agile team. During my almost 3 years at
                                    Admiral
                                    I became very experienced within the project and was responsible for a large amount
                                    of the
                                    growing codebase. I regularly supported the more junior members of the team. After
                                    our team
                                    transitioned to remote working I used tools such as screen-sharing to facilitate
                                    pair
                                    programming and knowledge transfer.</p>
                           </section>
                            <section>

                                <h3>My Role</h3>
                                <p>During my time at Admiral I worked on two distinct projects focused around a single
                                    Angular
                                    web app.
                                    The first project involved building a UI that could be used by pricing analysts to
                                    build and
                                    run
                                    business reports on the cloud. The second project was creating a case
                                    management system in which call centre agents and managers could use to visualise
                                    customer
                                    interactions, as well as providing insights into customer behaviour.</p>
                                <p>My role within the project is quite focussed on the frontend aspect of development.
                                    We
                                    are
                                    using Angular to create a set of portals for various departments within the
                                    business.
                                    However, I am a full-stack developer and often work with Java to complete full-stack
                                    stories
                                    where required. Being competent in both aspects of web development allows my team to
                                    use
                                    me
                                    flexibly should I be needed for a development or peer review task in either
                                    discipline.
                               </p>

                                <p>In terms of Angular experience, I have experience with the majority of basic, and
                                    many
                                    advanced concepts. This includes component design and communication, reactive and
                                    template-driven forms, custom form components (CVAs), and template injection. I am a
                                    big
                                    advocate of reusable code, combining this with Angular&rsquo;s component paradigm
                                    means
                                    I
                                    have good experience with creating reusable components. <br>
                                    I have contributed heavily to two of the portals in development, both giving me an
                                    opportunity to learn about different areas of the business, but also the ability to
                                    apply
                                    that context when developing the user interfaces.</p>

                                <p>We work in an agile environment, as well as the usual ceremonies we also hold chapter
                                    meetings and focus on continuous development with workshops and technical
                                    discussions.
                                    With
                                    this also being my first remote experience, I have adapted to working from home
                                    really
                                    well.
                                    Having effective communication with my teammates is essential; I maintain this by
                                    having
                                    regular calls with various colleagues on a one to one basis as well as in groups.
                                    Using
                                    tools such as screen share allows me to effectively collaborate with my colleagues.
                                    We
                                    use
                                    virtual whiteboards to share ideas and ensure we document the outcomes of meetings
                                    where
                                    necessary, for a three amigos session for example.<br>
                               </p>


                                <h4>Chapters and Guilds</h4>
                                <p>At Admiral agile had been a relatively new methodology of working as the business
                                    transitioned from a traditional insurance company to have more of a focus on tech.
                               </p>
                                <p>Chapters were created to facilitate regular knowledge transfer sessions as well as
                                    promoting
                                    a more social and
                                    collaborative working environment outside of your immediate team.</p>
                                <p>Not long before leaving Admiral I took a leading role, along with some colleagues, in
                                    organising a frontend guild. Similar to the chapter this allowed us to be more
                                    collaborative. The best part of a guild is that it's more focussed on a specific
                                    topic, but
                                    also is open to developers from other chapters; giving us the opportunity to share
                                    ideas
                                    and knowledge across the department.</p>

                        <p>Admiral is an award-winning, multi-national insurance company based in South Wales.</p>
                        <p>As part of Data and Analytics (DnA) I worked towards Admiral&rsquo;s digital data
                            goals by creating web applications that make use of data from cloud technology.
                            This provided a good user experience to allow faster and a more detailed business insight,
                            ultimately leading to more accurate and
                            effective business decisions.</p>
                        <p>At Admiral I worked within a self-organising agile team, alongside a product owner and squad
                            lead. During my almost 3 years there
                            I became very experienced within the project and had been responsible for designing and
                            writing a
                            large amount of the
                            growing codebase. The team grew from a size of 2 (myself and a colleague) to splitting into
                            two mid-sized teams; I
                            helped onboard and continually support the new members of the team in person, and virtually.
                            After our team
                            transitioned to remote working I used tools such as screen-sharing and conference calling to
                            facilitate the pair
                            programming and knowledge transfer that we had lost being at home.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>

                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p>During my time at Admiral I worked on two distinct projects focused around a single Angular
                            web app.
                            The first project involved building a UI that could be used by pricing analysts to build and
                            run
                            business reports on the cloud. The second project was creating a case
                            management system in which call centre agents and managers could use to visualise customer
                            interactions, as well as providing insights into customer behaviour.
                        </p>

                        <p>The technologies that I spent most of time with were <em>Angular</em>, <em>Java/Spring Boot</em>,
                            <em>transactional databases</em> and
                            <em>cloud services</em>.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Angular</h4>
                        <p>I have experience with the majority of basic, and many
                            advanced concepts of Angular. This includes component design and communication, reactive
                            and
                            template-driven forms, custom form components (CVAs), and template injection. I am a big
                            advocate of reusable code, combining this with Angular&rsquo;s component paradigm means
                            I
                            have good experience with creating reusable components. <br>
                            I have contributed heavily to two of the portals in development, both giving me an
                            opportunity to learn about different areas of the business, but also the ability to
                            apply
                            that context when developing the user interfaces.</p>

                        <h4>Java / Spring Boot</h4>
                        <p>Using Spring Boot to create multiple REST APIs that allow the frontend client to interact
                            with databases, in-house systems, as well as third parties; mainly products with in the Google Cloud
                            Platform.
                        </p>


                        <h4>Chapters and Guilds</h4>
                        <p>At Admiral agile had been a relatively new methodology of working as the business
                            transitioned from a traditional insurance company to have more of a focus on tech. Chapters
                            were created to facilitate regular knowledge transfer sessions as well as
                            promoting
                            a more social and
                            collaborative working environment outside of your immediate team.</p>
                        <p>Not long before leaving Admiral I took a leading role, along with some colleagues, in
                            organising a frontend guild. Similar to the chapter this allowed us to be more
                            collaborative. The best part of a guild is that it's more focussed on a specific topic,
                            but
                            also is open to developers from other chapters; giving us the opportunity to share ideas
                            and knowledge across the department.</p>

                        <h3>The Team</h3>
                        <p>Throughout my time at Vizolution I worked in a self-organising agile team. Our team
                            rotated through clients and projects, meaning we often worked with different product
                            owners;
                            this meant that we were regularly exposed to different code bases that were
                            developed by
                            other teams.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>

                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p>My main duty was to produce content and features for the 'vScreen' product; a remote
                            interactive presentation
                            platform.<br>
                            Call centre agents show a client a series of slides in which the client might
                            download
                            and
                            upload documents, digitally sign contracts and possibly video chat with the agent.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Branding</h4>
                        <p>Since our clients were well-established brands, I had to ensure that the content I
                            was
                            producing
                            adhered to the client's brand guidelines. If the client had not provided guidance,
                            then
                            I
                            would utilise an existing example of the client's branding to ensure my work aligned
                            with
                            the brand.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
                        <p>Several clients needed 'vScreen' to work on
                            a range of devices, especially phones and tablets. For one of our larger clients I
                            created a 'flexbox' stylesheet that would
                            allow
                            myself and
                            my colleagues to easily make the presentation scale to a number of different screen
                            sizes.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Browser Compatibility</h4>
                        <p>Since vScreen could be used anywhere, on almost any device, it was important that we
                            supported as many browsers as possible. Each client had their own browser
                            requirements,
                            sometimes including legacy browsers including older IE versions. This added some
                            complexity
                            to the development process and
                            sometimes workarounds had to be put in place to support older browsers.</p>

                        <h4>API Integration</h4>
                        <p>The most notable feature I developed was for a well-known bank customer who wanted to
                            take
                            card payments for mortgage application fees within vScreen. This involved working
                            with
                            an
                            API from WorldPay to allow clients to make card payments within the vScreen
                            presentation. It
                            was thrilling to know my work would help the customer sell mortgages more
                            efficiently,
                            and
                            ultimately help people buy their houses faster.</p>
                        <h4>Induction Task</h4>
                        <p>For my initial onboarding into the company, as a junior engineer my skills were put to the
                            test by creating a weather app. We used Vue to create the application, this was my first
                            experience using a JavaScript framework.</p>

                        <p>Myself and another student colleague
                            completed two projects focused on the company’s intranet. The first involved
                            re-implementing
                            the intranet’s legacy internal product information pages. This involved learning and
                            using
                            SQL, C#, as well as the concept of MVC for the first time. My colleague and I worked
                            together to produce the page and presented the final product to the end-users and the
                            warehouse staff.</p>
                        <p>Following the success of the product page, we were tasked to create a profile page area
                            for
                            the intranet. This would allow staff at the company to easily find colleagues contact
                            details, graphically see the managerial hierarchy for that colleague, and view other
